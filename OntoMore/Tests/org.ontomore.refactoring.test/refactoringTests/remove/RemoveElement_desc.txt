## Remove Disjoint Axioms
----------------------------
-- Description
Removes all disjoint axioms from all classes of the ontology.
This can be enhanced by removing only the disjoint axioms of
sub classes of the selected class (for which a post processor
might be necessary). 

-- Generic Refactoring
OntoMore generic refactoring: "Remove Contained X".

-- Problem
Disjoint axioms can currently be removed only from one single selected class
as refspec doesn't support loops so far.

If the selected class is referenced by another one in the DisjointWith-section
some strange things happen.
