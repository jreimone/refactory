## Move Axiom to SubClassOf-Section
----------------------------
-- Description
Move the selected axiom from the EquivalentTo-Section in the Class-Frame to the SubClassOf-Section.
EquivalentTo and SubClassOf are two different containing references from the meta class "Class" to the meta class "Description".
This refactoring might be chained in order to move all EquivalentTo-axioms at once.

-- Generic Refactoring
OntoMore: "Rereference X".

Similar to "Move X" and "Move X Loosely". The difference is,
that neither the container nor the order of the moved elements is changed, but the reference.

-- Problems
Role model assumes that there is at most one reference between two roles.
In this case we need to change the reference and have to model two references
between the same roles. The "set use of"-operator would need the information
about the reference to set as its no longer unambiguous.
