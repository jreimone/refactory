## Replace Data Value With Object
----------------------------
-- Description
Replaces the selected EAttribute by a EReference to a new EClass.
The new EReference gets the given name.
The new EClass gets the given name.

-- Generic Refactoring
"Replace Feature in Container" (OntoMore)

-- Problem
The name of the EReference can't be taken from the EAttribute
because in one EClass no several EStructuralFeatures with
the same name are allowed.
This causes the "Replace Data Value With Object" to have different
input values as the corresponding OWL refactoring "Convert Data
Property to Object Property".
