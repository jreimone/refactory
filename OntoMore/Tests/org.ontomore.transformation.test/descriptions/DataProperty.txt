DataProperty <--> EAttribute

DataProperty	 --> 	EAttribute
	iri						name
	domain					eContainingClass
	range					eType
	
The range of a DataProperty can be a user-defined Datatype or any of:
xsd:string
xsd:int
xsd:float
xsd:boolean

xsd:int is regarded to be the default. Therefore a transformation to EInt
takes place in case the datatype couldn't be determined or the proxy for
the datatype couldn't be resolved (the latter one is for xsd:int usually true).

Lowerbound and upperbound are set to the following defaults:
lowerBound = 0
upperBound = 1
