Refactory 0.8.0 released

Refactory is a framework to enable the definition of model refactorings.
The tooling is oriented at the Eclipse Language Toolkit (LTK) which offers
the well known refactorings from the JDT. After defining a refactoring for 
your DSL or meta model you can invoke it in a wizard being very similar to 
the LTK refactorings like 'Extract Method'.

To prepare a refactoring for a meta model Refactory follows a generic
approach because, as evaluated under http://emftext.org/index.php/Refactoring:Catalog,
model refactorings can be re-used in several metamodels. Following
this apporach a refactoring designer first has to define the 
participators, called 'roles', of a generic refactoring. Therefore
a meta model exists in Refactory for which a textual and a graphical 
syntax was specified. Then the steps must be defined, which the model
refactoring consists of. This will be achieved with an own transformation
language being able to declare re-structurings depending only on the 
defined roles. Those two models then compose a generic refactoring.
Both must be registered via an extension point. To activate such a
generic model refactoring the DSL or meta model designer then has to
apply a mapping of the defined roles onto the desired meta model.
To realize such a mapping Refactory comes up with a textual syntax
in which the URI of the target meta model and the name of the desired
role model has to be specified. Then the roles and collaborations
between them must only be mapped to meta classes and paths of relations.

Refactory consists of the following main features:
- several pre-defined and mapped generic refactorings (e.g. for
  Ecore, UML2 or BPMN)
- A connector for EMFText-based editors to invoke refactorings on
  EMFText DSLs
- A connector for GMF-based editors to invoke refactorings directly
  in GMF editors
- implement and register your own editor connectors
- Updating of direct and inverse references when refactoring a model
  using the Sokan index connector which then enables the propagation
  of changes to dependend models
- A registry view where all defined refactorings can be found
