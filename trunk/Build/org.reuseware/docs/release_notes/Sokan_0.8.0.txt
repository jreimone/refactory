Sokan Workspace Indexing Framework 0.8.0 released

Sokan is an extensible framework to index files in Eclipse Workspaces.
Depending on the set of registered indexers, arbitrary indexes can be
created and maintained. Sokan is for example used by Refactory to find
cross-references between models in workspaces.
