## Make All Individuals Distinct
----------------------------
-- Description
Creates a DifferentIndividuals-Axiom
that states the difference of all individuals of the ontology. 

-- Generic Refactoring
OntoMore: "Introduce Referer To All X".
Similar to "Introduce Reference Class". The difference is that the input-role
should be the container and the newly created referer-element doesn't have
any attributes.

-- Problem
Refactoring is not provided to be executed. Some preconditions aren't met.
Problem is the same as with Convert "Data Property to Object Property":
Modeling one containment reference as two in the role model to refer to two different
kinds of child-elements does not work.

Update: Refactoring is provided but it throws
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: implement this case
