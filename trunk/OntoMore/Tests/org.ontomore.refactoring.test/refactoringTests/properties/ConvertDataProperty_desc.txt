## Convert Data Property To Object Property
----------------------------
-- Description
Creates a new object property moves attribute values and references from the
selected data property to it and removes the original data property.

-- Generic Refactoring
Nothing applicable.

-- Problem
Ontology hold the same containment relationship to different child-elements.
It is not possible to model two different relationships in the role model.

Role implication cannot be used to model sub-super-class-relationships.
Role implication inheritance constraint is needed.
