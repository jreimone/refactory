## Move Axiom to EquivalentTo-Section
----------------------------
-- Description
Move the selected axiom from the SubClassOf-Section in the Class-Frame to the EquivalentTo-Section.
This is the inverse to "Move Axiom to SubClassOf-Section".
This refactoring might be chained in order to move all SubClassOf-axioms at once.

-- Generic Refactoring
Similar to "Move X" and "Move X" Loosely. The difference is,
that neither the container nor the order of the moved elements is changed, but the reference.
