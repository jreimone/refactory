Class-FeatureRestriction <--> EReference

FeatureReference-ObjectProperty(iri) --> EReference(name)

ObjectPropertySome-ClassAtomic(clazz) --> EReference(type)
                                      --> EReference(LowerBound := 1)
                                      --> EReference(UpperBound := -1)
                                      
Based on the OWA in the ontology individuals of class Person are possible, who don't have a
relationship to an individual of class Pet. In Ecore however every individual belonging to
a class with a reference has to have this reference to another individual of the appropriated
class (according to the given cardinality).

This case can't be reasonable converted. It violates the assumptions on convertible ontologies.
