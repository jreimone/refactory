## Remove Inverse Property
----------------------------
-- Description
Removes the ObjectProperty that is referenced by the selected
ObjectProperty through the inverseOf reference.
This is the inverse refactoring to "Introduce Inverse Property".

-- Generic Refactoring
"Remove Contained X" (OntoMore)

-- Problems
InverseOf-reference isn't removed.

Same problem as with Rename Element with refactoring over an newly opened file.
