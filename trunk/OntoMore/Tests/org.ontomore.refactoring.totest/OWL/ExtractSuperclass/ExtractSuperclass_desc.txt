## Extract Superclass
----------------------------
-- Description
Create new class, move the selected ObjectProperty or DataProperty
to that class. Make the new class a superclass of the domain of the
property and put it as new domain. 

-- Generic Refactoring
"Extract Loosely X" (OntoMore)

-- Issues
The Superclass could be put before not after the original class.

-- Problems
Same problem as with Rename Element with refactoring over an newly opened file.
