## Pull Up Field
----------------------------
-- Description
Moves the selected EAttribute or EReference
to the superclass of the containing EClass.

-- Issues
Already implemented as "Pull Up Feature" with "Move X".

-- Generic Refactoring
"Move X"

-- Problems
Changing to the generic refactoring "RereferenceX" (OntoMore) doesn't work.
This generic refactoring would be the same as for the corresponding
OWL refactoring "Pull Up Property". See OWL/PullUpProperty/PullUpProperty_desc.txt
