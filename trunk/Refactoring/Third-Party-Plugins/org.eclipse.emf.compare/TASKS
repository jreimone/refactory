___ TODO ___
 - complete documentation and tutorials
      - coding a match engine
      - extending diff metamodel
 - cleaning up API, Extensible Factor system for generic engine
 - supporting dependencies design for merging
 - weight annotations for metamodels
 
___ DONE ___
27/11/2007 - API broken for match engines : added method in interface org.eclipse.emf.compare.match.api.MatchEngine for content comparison.
07/11/2007 - DiffService, MatchService and MergeService modified to allow full standalone usage
05/11/2007 - Enabled internationalization
29/10/2007 - Merger API greatly modified. A new extension point appears to provide a list of merger associated to DiffElements.
	- org.eclipse.emf.compare.diff.merge.service.MergeService has been modified and is now the main mean of merging.
	- Events are now fired before and after 1) a merge operation (merging of one or more diffs) and 2) a diff merge (for each difference).
		Clients can register listeners for these event via MergeService#addMergeListener(IMergeListener).
	- org.eclipse.emf.compare.diff.merge.service.MergeFactory has been modified and will now parse registered extensions to check for provided mergers.
	- about MergerProviders and priorities, priority takes precedence over file extension :
		- plugin A provides mergers for its own DiffElements (DiffB, DiffC) and overrides the behavior of core DiffElement (DiffA), all with "normal" priority and targeted to uml extensions (.uml)
		- plugin B provides mergers overriding the behavior of core DiffElements (DiffA) with priority "high" and target to all file extensions (*)
		- for an uml model (model.uml) the merger used for DiffB and DiffC will be the ones provided by plugin A, whereas  DiffA will be merged with the merger provided by plugin B
		- when two plugins provide distinct mergers for the same DiffElement with the same priority, file extension takes precedence
26/10/2007 - priorities of all contributed extensions (match engine, diff engine, ...) is now "lowest"
18/10/2007 - created preferences to ignore XMI ID when comparing and to supress drawing of differences markers
16/10/2007 - modified match to allow an options map to be passed as argument
04/10/2007 - UI package refactoring
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.contentmergeviewer.* => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.*
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.contentprovider.PropertyContentProvider => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.part.property.PropertyContentProvider
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.contentprovider.ModelStructureMergeContentProvider => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.structure.ModelStructureMergeContentProvider
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.contentprovider.ModelContentMergeContentProvider => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.ModelContentMergeContentProvider
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.structuremergeviewer.* => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.structure.*
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewerparts.ModelContentMergeViewerPart => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.part.ModelContentMergeViewerPart
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewerparts.ModelContentMergeTreePart => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.part.tree.ModelContentMergeTreePart
	org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewerparts.ModelContentMergePropertyPart => org.eclipse.emf.compare.ui.viewer.content.part.property.ModelContentMergePropertyPart
14/08/2007 - using functional ID through Ecore ID
14/08/2007 - diff extension API
14/08/2007 - export diff as API
30/07/2007 - (DRAFT) - export diff as... extension point
30/07/2007 - 3 Way compare
10/07/2007 - suppress unused code
05/07/2007 - better browsing when using XMI_ID
28/06/2007 - merge on moveoperation
14/06/2007 - cleanup GUI 
07/06/2007 - open .diff files with compare editor
10/05/2007 - (LAURENT) dynamic icons for diff model using the element icons
23/04/2007 - remove UML2 dependencie for icons and use item providers for others
17/04/2007 - hierarchy in diff model
16/04/2007 - handle the case where many elements still need to be mapped 
 without reaching a n^n complexity => using a max window
16/04/2007 - use StringBuffer
13/04/2007 - maplists should map with the best matching of the list (not the first)
13/04/2007 - filter unused metamodel elements  (for instance many stuffs in UML are not really used in models..)
12/04/2007 - progress monitor and cancel support
12/04/2007 - cleaning up UI (remove uneeded buttons, diagram tabs...)
12/04/2007 - save diff action
