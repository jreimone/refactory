## Pull Up Axiom
----------------------------
-- Description
Move the selected axiom to the (existing) super class.
This should work for arbitrary axioms (meta class "Description") of classes.

-- Generic Refactoring
"Move X"

-- Problem
Not yet supported by Refactory:
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: This case must be implemented!
	at org.emftext.refactoring.interpreter.internal.ObjectAssignmentInterpreter.getEObjectWithRoleFromPath(ObjectAssignmentInterpreter.java:359)

For arbitrary movements the refactoring is becoming more complex and doesn't fit to "Move X" any more. 
Similar to "Move X". The difference is, that the type of the reference has to be considered.
"Move X" defines a reference between source and target container, that don't exists in
this case between the classes of the ontology!
	SourceContainer := Class;
	TargetContainer := Class;
	Movee := Description;
