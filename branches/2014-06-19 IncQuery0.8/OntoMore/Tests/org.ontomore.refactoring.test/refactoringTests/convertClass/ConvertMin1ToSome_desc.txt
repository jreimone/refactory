## Convert Min 1 To Some
----------------------------
-- Description
Replaces all Min1-FeatureRestrictions to the some-FeatureRestriction,
which is equal in meaning. This leads to a better understanding because
the same words are used for the same meaning. Furthermore it might be
possible to use a simpler description logic for reasoning.

-- Generic Refactoring
OntoMore generic refactoring: Replace Feature

-- Problem
Same problem as in "Convert Data Property". The container holds the same
containment reference to different elements.

Edit: does work with replace feature, but the sub-elements have to be converted.
