/**
This role model is a very simple one but with extensive impacts because it is one of the more often
used refactorings in practice. 'Rename Method' has to be used if one wants to rename the methods name
and update all references to this method that they stay consistent. Originally <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/renameMethod.html">Rename Method</a> 
comes from the Fowler book.
