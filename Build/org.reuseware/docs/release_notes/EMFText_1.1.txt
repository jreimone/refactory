EMFText 1.1 released

The fastest way to refinable, durable and evolution-resistant textual
syntaxes for EMF models just got even better.

EMFText is an Eclipse plug-in that allows you to define text syntax
for languages described by an Ecore metamodel. EMFText enables
developers to define textual Domain Specific Languages quickly and
without the need to learn new technologies and concepts. Give it a
shot and you'll find EMFText indispensible for your model-driven
development processes.

With version 1.1, EMFText is more stable and brings some useful new
features: 
- It is now possible to define colour and style of your syntax 
  directly in the CS specification. 
- EMFText now generates a customizable New File Wizard for your 
  language that is automatically able to create an initial model. 
- The CS analysis has improved and now gives you much more 
  information about where you might want to improve your syntax.

On the update site you can now find more than 20 ready made languages,
including: 
- The complete Java5 syntax 
- The complete OWL Manchester syntax 
- A complete textual Ecore syntax

You can download the tool, watch a screencast, or read the
documentation at http://www.emftext.org.

Enjoy! :-)
