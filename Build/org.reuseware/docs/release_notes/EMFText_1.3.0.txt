EMFText 1.3.0 released

The fastest way to refinable, durable and evolution-resistant textual
syntaxes for EMF models just got even better.

EMFText is an Eclipse plug-in that allows you to define text syntax
for languages described by an Ecore metamodel. EMFText enables
developers to define textual Domain Specific Languages quickly and
without the need to learn new technologies and concepts. Give it a
shot and you'll find EMFText indispensible for your model-driven
development processes.

With version 1.3.0, EMFText is more stable and brings some useful new
features: 
- It is now possible to define syntax for expressions (nested, left-
  recursive structures) more easily. 
- EMFText now offers a New Project Wizard, which lets you setup a new
  DSL project within seconds. 
- The printing of models has been substantially improved. Layout (e.g.,
  whitespace and linebreaks) are now preserved even when applying M2M
  transformations to models.

On the update site you can now find more than 40 ready made languages,
including: 
- The complete Java5 syntax 
- A complete textual Ecore syntax
- The complete OWL Manchester syntax
- eJava - a language to add EOperation bodies to Ecore models 

Many more languages are available on the Website in the Concrete Syntax 
Zoo.

You can download the tool, watch a screencast, or read the
documentation at http://www.emftext.org.

Enjoy! :-)
