JaMoPP: The Java Model Parser and Printer - 1.0 released

We are pleased to announce that JaMoPP 1.0 is now available at
http://jamopp.inf.tu-dresden.de 
and from our update site at
http://reuseware.org/update

JaMoPP consists of (1) a complete Java5 Ecore Metamodel (2) a complete
Java5 EMFText Syntax and (3) an implementation of Java5's static
semantics analysis. Through JaMoPP, any Java program can be processed
as any other EMF model. JaMoPP therefore bridges the gap between
modelling and Java programming. JaMoPP enables the application of
arbitrary EMF-based tools on full Java programs. Since JaMoPP is
developed through metamodelling and code generation, extending Java 
and embedding Java into other modelling languages, using standard
metamodeling techniques and tools, is now possible. To ensure the
quality of JaMoPP, it has been successfully tested on a code base 
of 79.017 Java files of today's most famous Java projects.

JaMoPP has already been utilised successfully in a number of
applications: 
- to create a safe template language for Java 
- to generate code through model-2-model transformations 
- to embed Java statements into UML 
- to visualize Java programs using GMF 
- to map features to Java programs using the FeatureMapper 
- to extend Java with new reuse concepts processable by Reuseware 
- to perform static source code analysis with OCL

If you are working with models AND Java, you should try JaMoPP and 
see how it can help you in your model-driven development process!
