/**
This RoleModel is specifically designed for the FeatureMapper metamodel (http://www.tudresden.de/featuremapping).
This RoleModel contains some Derivees, from which another element is intended to be derived. The derivation then
gets associated with the derivees.<br>
Use this RoleModel not only for the FeatureMapper metamodel but all other metamodels having similar structures and
semantics.
<br><br>
