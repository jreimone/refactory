 * of a method in the 'Extract Method' refactoring for Java. 
 * <br><br>
 * Every {@link IRefactoringPostProcessor} will be registered in the {@link IRoleMappingRegistry} and is therein
 * connected to a {@link Mapping}. That means that every postprocessor belongs to a specific metamodel and a specific
 * {@link Mapping mapping} in the {@link RoleMappingModel role mapping} registered for that metamodel.
